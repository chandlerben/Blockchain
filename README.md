# Block-Chain-Python

Creating a blockchain-style miner and wallet viewer to learn blockchain and cryptocurrency concepts.  The project has been split into three folders:

**Client-Mining**

This is where a client can mine for cryptocurrency and can check answers that they find against the correct hash.

**Communication_GP**

This is adding in the communication with a community blockchain, see if an answer for the last block has already been found and, if not, submits the client's answer.
